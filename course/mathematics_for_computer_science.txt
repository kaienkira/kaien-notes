mathematical proof
    def: a verification of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions from a set of axioms

proposition(命题)
    def: a statement that is either true or false
    ex: a^4 + b^4 + c^4  = d^4 has no positive integer solutions
        a = 95800, b = 217519, c = 414560, d = 422481

implication(实质条件)
    def: (p => q) p implies q is said to be true if p is false or q is true

axiom(公理)
    def: a proposition that is assumed to be true
    axioms should be *consistent* and *complete*
    a set of axioms is consistent if no proposition can be proved to be both true and false
    A set of axioms is said to be complete if it can be used to prove every proposition is either true or false
