*. a let can only begin a statement, not an expression
*. the value of an assignment is an empty tuple ()
*. Using a return as the last line of a function works
   but is considered poor style
*. diverging functions: functions that do not return
    fn diverges() -> ! {}

bool
char
     represents a single Unicode scalar value
     Rust's char is not a single byte, but four
i8,i16,i32,i64
u8,u16,u32,u64
isize,usize
    size depends on the size of a pointer of the underlying machine
f32,f64
str
array [T; N]
    fixed-size list of elements of the same type
    indexing: a[0]
tuple (...)
    indexing: t.0
slice
    a reference to (or 'view' into) another data structure

-*- Ownership -*-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*. variable bindings 'have ownership' of what they are bound to
   when a binding goes out of scope, Rust will free the bound resources
*. Rust ensures that there is exactly one binding to any given resource
*. All primitive types implement the Copy trait and
   their ownership is therefore not moved

*. any borrow must last for a scope no greater than that of the owner
*. the mutable borrow prevents subsequent moves, borrows, or modification
   until the borrow ends
*. one or more references (&T) to a resource
   exactly one mutable reference (&mut T)


===============================================================================
* Rust has two main types of strings: &str and String
  &str is called "string slices"
    [] statically allocated string
    [] have a fixed size, and cannot be mutated
  String 
    [] heap-allocated string
    [] commonly created by converting from a string slice
       using the to_string method
    [] Strings will coerce into &str with an &
*. All strings are guaranteed to be a valid encoding of UTF-8 sequences
*. Viewing a String as a &str is cheap,
   but converting the &str to a String involves allocating memory
*. Because strings are valid UTF-8, strings do not support indexing
